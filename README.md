# HTML Review Resource

In groups, we will create a review resource for our class.

## Group Assignments

Groups will create pages, based on the group assignments below.

1. main, aside
2. nav, a
3. header, img
4. footer, em
5. article, strong
6. section, headings 
7. head: Might need to revise sections to include the 2 types of elements within the head 
8. lists, p
9. div, span

## Content Directions

This assignment will help you practice reading and navigating HTML files with existing code, since you will create marked-up content within the templated sections.

1. Create your pages by copying and pasting the `to-copy-only.html` file into the correct subfolder.
2. Rename the file with the HTML element name. `nav` woule be `nav.html` within the `block` subfolder, since it is a block element.
3. Fill out the areas within the page, including:
   1. Titles and headings
   2. Definition
   3. Semantics
   4. Attributes &amp; Values
   5. Accessibility
   6. Examples
   7. Sources and Resources

## Logistical Suggestions

I suggest that each group consider the following workflow:

- Everyone set their code editors to 2 spaces for this class to ensure consistency.
- Divide up the content work.
- Commit and push changes as you make them, not in one big chunk.
- Once you've complete a full draft, open any issues with your group about your code/content or their code/content. 
  - Be sure to consider attention to indentation schemes, tag completion, and semantic usage of new elements.

## Submission

Submit your reviewed and revised code by the end of Tuesday, 02/09, at 11:59pm in Canvas. We will now use this resource to help us prepare  for the HTML exam.

Submit it with the URL scheme for your page online: 
- Block elements: `https://engl-4814.github.io/html-review/block/enter-page.html`
- Inline elements: `https://engl-4814.github.io/html-review/inline/enter-page.html`
- So the `main` page would be `https://engl-4814.github.io/html-review/block/main.html`, since it's a block element.
