# HTML Review Resource

In groups, we will create a review resource for our class.

## Group Assignments

Groups will create pages, based on the group assignments below.

1. main, aside
2. nav, a
3. header, img
4. footer, em
5. article, strong
6. section, headings 
7. head: Might need to revise sections to include the 2 types of elements within the head 
8. lists, p
9. div, span


This assignment will help you practice reading and navigating HTML files with existing code, since you will create marked-up content within the templated sections.

1. Create your pages by copying and pasting the `to-copy-only.html` file into the correct subfolder.
2. Rename the file with the HTML element name. `nav` woule be `nav.html` within the `block` subfolder, since it is a block element.
3. Fill out the areas within the templates, including:
   1. Titles and headings
   2. Definition
   3. Semantics
   4. Behavior
   5. Accessibility
   6. Examples
